            <p>
                Recently I ran a user research project at work which aimed to validate the assumptions the Product
                Team had on how to improve a content management system (CMS) for regulatory content. The project was
                divided into two parts, firstly to find out where users got the most value out of the current CMS
                and secondly to understand their step by step process for monitoring, managing, communicating and
                reviewing change in their organisation. I worked alongside a Product Marketing colleague to complete
                this project. In total, we interviewed 17 customers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The research findings aided the Product Team to develop a set of requirements which reflected their best
                understanding about what the users needed in a CMS. The findings, and subsequent requirements, were used
                by the Research & Innovation (R&I) team to identify the possibility of adding features that take
                advantage of machine learning and to develop a proof of concept (PoC) for what the CMS could look like.
            </p>
            <p>
                This case study outlines my research process, the challenges I faced, the successes and areas of
                improvement.
            </p>
            <h3>Step 1: Planning the research</h3>
            <p>
                To plan the research project I engaged the Product Manager and stakeholders early, and regularly, in the
                planning process. I got regular feedback on the discussion guide, ensuring it met their expectations and
                covered all topic areas. This helped me avoid potentially missing key pieces of information when
                conducting the interviews. The online whiteboarding tool, Miro, helped me achieve this because of its
                flexibility to brainstorm, collaborative nature, ease of leaving comments, and its accessibility within
                the company. This made it easy for stakeholders to give their input and leave feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to the success of this approach, I will continue to engage stakeholders in the planning stages of
                research. Regular communication and feedback with them gave me the confidence that I was meeting their
                expectations, and our understanding was aligned. From their perspective, it ensured I was on track with
                the work and understood their aims and needs. Subsequently, I believe this positive working relationship
                between us in the planning process ensured I delivered the expected outputs and avoided any
                miscommunication and misunderstandings.
            </p>
            <div class=case-study-images>
                <img src="Illustrations/feedback.png" alt="Person asking for feedback on their work"
                    class="inline-image" loading="lazy">
                <figcaption>Person asking for feedback on their work</figcaption>
            </div>
            <p>
                Originally, research sessions were organised via long email chains. This was not a streamlined process
                and was time-consuming and annoying for the participant and I. To organise the interviews for this
                project, I used the scheduling tool Calendly. For me, making the sign-up process quick and easy for
                participants was important for decreasing the number of potential drop-offs. Since using Calendly, I
                have significantly improved my process for organising research sessions. As a next step, I need to share
                this tool with my team, so we have a shared process when organising research.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite Covid-19, we planned to conduct remote interviews because it was quicker and cheaper than
                in-person interviews. Also, we were interviewing users to understand their process rather than observing
                their behaviour.

            </div>
            <h3>Step 2: Recruiting participants</h3>
            <p>
                Recruiting the participants was the most challenging stage of this project. The user research culture
                within the organisation was not well established and the companies target audience was niche. This made
                it difficult to recruit enough participants who met the desired characteristics. As a result, my
                colleague worked with the Marketing team in both parts of the project, to collate a list of potential
                customers to contact and invite to participate. I felt this was the best approach for several reasons.
                Firstly, my colleague knew the process of sending out communications and had access to the customer
                database. Secondly, Marketing could help us make sure we met GDPR regulations and only contact customers
                who had consented to hear from us. However, their method of convenience sampling was problematic for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most significant issue of this sampling and recruitment approach was the bias it created within our
                sample. Due to their previous communications with the company, the selected contacts appeared to all be
                engaged with the organisation, product and wanted to help. Therefore, they were not representative of
                the entire customer base. This meant we did not have a range of alternative perspectives and
                experiences. This experience taught me the importance of having a representative and adequately sized
                target audience to draw participants from. To avoid this issue in the future, I will employ a sampling
                methods such as systematic or stratified, to ensure a representative sample is drawn from the target
                audience.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the second part of the project, the goal was to speak to 5 participants. More would have been
                better, but we decided to set a realistic and achievable number due to limited access to potential
                candidates, as previously described. Only one customer responded to the initial research invite. This
                felt disappointing as in the first round of research numerous customers responded to our invite quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                To overcome this situation, I took the initiative to engage the Customer Success team to recruit
                participants. As a result of working with the team, 13 interviews were arranged in total (many more than
                the original plan of 5!). I involved the Customer Success team for various reasons. Firstly, as with the
                Marketing team, they are in a customer-facing role and speak to customers every day. This placed them in
                an ideal position to promote the research. Secondly, I wanted to avoid duplicated effort across the
                business, prevent siloed working and make the business look cohesive from a customer perspective. This
                experience showed me how difficult it can be to contact customers. In the future, I will engage this
                team earlier in the recruitment process to utilise their contacts and resources to promote the research.
                It also demonstrated how UX and user research could work with other customer-facing departments such as
                Sales, Customer Support and the Implementations team. As a next step, my manager, team and I should aim
                to increase the businesses awareness of user research, its purpose and how others can work with us to
                perform it.
            </p>

                    class="inline-image" loading="lazy">
                <figcaption>Person connecting with other business areas</figcaption>
            </div>
            <p>
                One key learning from this challenging situation was the importance of keeping the stakeholder informed.
                I learnt that positive stakeholder relationships are not only built on "good" events but the challenges
                too. It builds a relationship on trust and confidence, shows you are a responsible individual, can take
                ownership of your work and have the initiative to overcome problems. These are all skills that
                management and stakeholders look for, making it more likely that new projects and opportunities will
                open up for you.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 3: Conducting the research</h3>
            <p>I purposefully organised the interviews to be spread out over a couple of weeks. In previous projects, I
                aimed to get the interviews completed as quickly as possible. Although this is required in some
                scenarios, for example, when there are tight deadlines. It is not always optimal due to interview
                fatigue. I found conducting the interviews and doing the analysis in a repetitive cycle improved my
                ability to digest and analyse the findings. Avoiding a linear process meant I was not overwhelmed with
                information and did not experience tiredness and lack of concentration after completing all the
                interviews. It also gave me time to reflect on the findings and formulate themes and differences between
                each interview. I found this approach effective and will aim to repeat it in the future. In situations
                where circumstances require a more linear approach, I will manage my time and allow myself and others
                involved, to reflect on each research session even if it means not doing a full analysis of it.
            </p>

                <img src="Illustrations/conduct.png" alt="Two people in a remote meeting" class="inline-image"
                    loading="lazy">
                <figcaption>A researcher and participant in a remote research session</figcaption>
            </div>
            <p>
                Due to the nature of the business enterprise, some of the participants I spoke to were dissatisfied with
                the current version of their product. To begin with, I found this challenging because I felt unsure
                about how to respond to their queries and comments, manage their expectations and provide solutions to
                their problems. However, as I performed more interviews, I became more confident and sure of my
                responses. My main takeaway was to answer their questions as best you can, but be honest with the
                participant/customer, tell them when you don't know the answer, ask for input from another colleague or
                put them in contact with the appropriate member of staff. This proactive approach will provide
                satisfaction, make them feel listened to and initiate a solution to their problem. To deal with
                situations where the participant spoke off-topic, I used my discussion guide to steer the conversation
                back on track. I found this useful because it helped me do so in a considerate way and ensured I got
                what I needed from the research. Learning how to keep a balance between satisfying the participant and
                letting them express their thoughts as a paying customer, whilst achieving my own goals, was an
                interesting learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                To maintain stakeholder engagement, I invited the Product Manager to the first interview. Listening to
                the participant first hand, helps them to truly understand their user's needs and dislodge any
                assumptions they have. This will help them make reliable product decisions. Also, stakeholder buy adds
                credibility to your work when putting the findings and recommendations into practice. I found their
                attendance useful because they gave feedback and identified areas of improvement. I also noted how they
                concisely described and explained topics and product features, so I could reuse the dialogue in the
                following interviews. This helped me develop my interviewing technique and style which made the sessions
                run more smoothly.
            </p>
            <p>The key points I will take from these experiences and aim to implement in future research projects are:
                spread the research sessions out to avoid fatigue and make time for analysis; understand what methods
                the company has for resolving customer issues; always have a discussion guide on hand to keep the
                conversation on track and invite the stakeholder to the research to improve yourself, gain credibility
                and improve their understanding of the user.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 4: Presenting and disseminating findings</h3>
            <p> Due to annual leave I was not involved in the analysis process. As a result, my colleague took the lead
                to present the research findings and recommendations to the stakeholders.
                After the presentation, colleagues in others of the business were interested in our research, this
                time I presented the findings. At the start, I felt nervous in case I could not
                answer their questions or explain things properly. These worries were unnecessary as I understood the
                subject matter and didn't experience any
                problems. Confidently presenting research findings is an important skill. If findings are not
                communicated to decision-makers, they will not have any impact. My one takeaway from this
                experience is to invest time and effort into gaining adequate subject knowledge and practice speaking
                about different subjects, as this will improve my presentation skills and confidence.
            </p>
            <div class=case-study-images>
                <img src="Illustrations/presentation2.png"
                    alt="Two people presenting their work on an online collaboration tool" class="inline-image"
                    loading="lazy">
                <figcaption>Presenting findings via an online collaboration tool</figcaption>
            </div>
            <p>Repeating the research presentation to other business areas highlighted inefficiencies within the company
                because time and effort was duplicated. In the future, the dissemination of research could be improved
                by having a central research repository in the company. Having learned a lot about research repositories
                from the ResearchOps community, I believed this was something the company would benefit from. For
                example, helping to build a research culture, saving time and effort and encouraging collaborative
                working.
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>This project aimed to validate the assumptions the Product Team had on how to improve a CMS for the
                regulatory content. This was achieved by performing 15 interviews with customers and presenting the
                findings and recommendations to the Product Team. By carrying out this research, the Product Manager
                formulated a set of requirements that reflected their best understanding of what the users needed in a
                CMS. The findings, recommendations and subsequent requirements were used by the R&I team to develop a
                PoC of what the CMS could look like and its machine learning capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>Outlined below are some of my key learnings that I will aim to implement in future research projects, and
                in some cases improve upon.
