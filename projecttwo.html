            </div>
            <p>
                At work I was recently tasked with designing a filter, sort and search system to hand off to the
                Development team to implement in one of the organisation's products. The project had been started by a
                colleague a few months prior and had been reallocated to me due to changes in workload. My involvement
                facilitated the progression of the project as a result of conducting user research. My one key learning
                was the importance of communication, especially between design and development teams.
            </p>
            <p>
                This case study outlines what went well, the challenges I faced, how I overcame them and the impact my
                actions had on the project. The following sections will be discussed:
            </p>
            <ol class="case-study-text">
                <li class="case-study-list">Speak up if you don't think something is right </li>

                <li class="case-study-list">Communicate with developers</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>1. Speak up if you don't think something is right</h3>
            <p>The problem with the initial design was that the proposed dropdown components didn't accommodate for the
                dependencies between the multiple filter criteria. I couldn't understand how the design and its
                behaviours handled the filtering system. I was sure this was a contributing factor to the project's lack
                of progress.
            </p>
            <div class=case-study-images>
                <img src="Illustrations/speakup.png" alt="A person with a speeech bubble" class="inline-image"
                    loading="lazy">
                <figcaption>A person speaking up</figcaption>
            </div>

            <p>To resolve this issue, I took the initiative to research alternative types of filter systems. Based on
                the given filter requirements I produced low fidelity wireframe using a tag cloud and mapped out the
                filter dependencies using a matrix. I proposed my ideas to the Product Managers (PMs) and explained why
                I thought this was a better alternative to the initial designs. They agreed my approach was clearer and
                approved the work to be taken forward to development.
            </p>
            <p>From this experience, I learnt the importance of speaking up when something feels wrong. My new design
                and behaviours resolved confusion which meant the project could progress from the deadlock it had been
                in. I could start performing user research and the developers could explore the backend behaviour.
            </p>
            <p>Making your voice heard, at the appropriate time, will facilitate discussion and ideation. It can
                challenge traditional ways of thinking and processes, encourages innovation, inspires others and
                provides trust and leadership. If you are open and honest it will encourage others to give feedback and
                share their perspectives. Doing this respectfully and consistently will turn you into a person that
                people turn to when they want honest and constructive feedback. This will allow you to exercise your
                influence, drive the direction of projects and open unexpected opportunities for yourself.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Build a relationship with the stakeholders</h3>
            <p>The main benefit of engaging stakeholders in this project was their approval of, and consequent
                involvement in, user research. Historically in the company, design and development time has been hand to
                mouth, designing one week and developing the next. The company culture meant user research and testing
                wasn't seen as integral to the design and development life cycle. In addition, UX was not seen as a
                customer-facing role which meant there weren't any processes in place to conduct research. Despite these
                challenges and due to the complex nature of the feature, I proposed to the PMs that we perform user
                research. Fortunately, they agreed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their approval can be attributed to several things. Firstly, as stakeholders I built a good working
                relationship with them by continuously presenting work and ideas with evidence and reasoning, updating
                them on progress, challenging ideas and decisions and asking for feedback. As a result, the confidence
                and trust they had in me grew, which meant I could push boundaries, challenge processes and the mindset
                of "That's just the way things are done".
            </p>
            <div class=case-study-images>
                <img src="Illustrations/breakingbarriers.png"
                    alt="Person kicking a ball against a wall and breaking it down" class="inline-image" loading="lazy">
                <figcaption>Breaking down barriers in the workplace</figcaption>
            </div>
            <p>
                Secondly, I started small and aimed to try something new to
                see a small incremental change. Little projects such as this, although not always perfect, can be used
                as evidence when making lasting change. For example, ideally, this user research would have been
                completed at the start, and continuously throughout, the project, not once halfway through. In an ideal
                world, I would have liked to speak to more than 3 customers. Nevertheless, the fact I managed to speak
                to anyone demonstrated a noticeable shift in attitude and understanding about the role of research in
                developing software and that I had begun to break down the historical organisational boundaries. Small
                wins such as these are valuable because they add up to create the bigger picture of lasting change. In
                my case making user research and testing a mandatory part of the design and development life cycle.
            </p>
            <p>The impact of conducting user research on the project was obvious. We now understood our user's needs
                better. This meant I could work with the PMs to clearly, and more easily, define the requirements and
                align understanding between Product, UX and Development about what we were trying to achieve.
            </p>
            <div class=case-study-images>
                <img src="Illustrations/stakeholder.png" alt="Two people in discussion" class="inline-image"
                    loading="lazy">

            </div>
            <h3>3. Know your participants</h3>
            <p>The organisation's products are customisable and each customer has different features in their product
                across different versions. I felt apprehensive before speaking to each customer because I did not have
                all the knowledge about their particular product and couldn't tailor the questions to them specifically.
            </p>
            <P>
                To overcome this I asked open-ended discussion points such as "Tell me about...", "Can you explain
                how...". Presenting questions like
                this allows you to subtly build a picture of the participant without them knowing. I also asked them to
                share their screen so I could visibly see what product they had. Doing this allows you to ask questions
                about specific features on the screen. Once understanding is gained, and the participant feels
                comfortable, the conversation flows naturally.
            </P>
            <P>
                Setting up a customer database, where key information about each customer is stored and easily
                accessible to anyone in the company, would be beneficial for user research in the future. A tool such as
                this would prepare user researchers in advance of their sessions, encourage collaboration and the
                sharing of knowledge between customer-facing roles, and make the company look more professional and
                coherent from a customer perspective.
            </P>
            <H3>
                4. Manage participant expectations
            </H3>
            <p>
                During one interview, I felt some tension between the customer and the organisation when the participant
                realised they would not get the feature we were discussing unless they paid to upgrade their product.
            </p>
            <p>
                Researching customers with existing products can be more difficult than research on the general public.
                Customers expect a level of knowledge and preparation, they want to get something out of taking part and
                understand how they will benefit. In comparison, the general population is unlikely to have
                expectations, will take part out of self-interest or chance (depending on the sample and research
                method) and will accept more ambiguity about the nature of the research, compared to paying customers.
            </p>
            <p>
                To avoid situations such as these it is important to manage the participant's expectations. Communicate
                to the participant at the invite stage what the nature and purpose of the research is, allow open
                dialogue between the participant and yourself, invite them to ask you questions before the research is
                completed, and be transparent about the use of the research. Addressing these potential issues early
                will reduce misunderstanding later.
            </p>

                5. Use Miro to collaborate
            </h3>
            <p>
                To analyse the findings, I worked remotely with a junior colleague. We used Miro to create an affinity
                map then categorised and themed the findings. After this, I formulated solutions for each finding and
                prioritised them into short term and long term features.
            </p>
            <div class=case-study-images>

            </div>
            <p>
                Miro allows you to collaborate with others, on the same thing at the same time whilst showing real-time
                changes. Paired with a video call, you can complete your work more quickly because you can discuss,
                share ideas and thoughts in real-time. You don't need to wait for someone to upload their work and wait
                for communication so they can explain what they have done. Also, you know you are always working on the
                latest version of something.
            </p>
            <p>
                Compared to other products, such as Trello, Miro makes it easy to organise ideas and collect notes. You
                are not constrained to a layout or a specific order and this encourages you to work flexibly and freely.
                In addition, Miro boards are infinite, so all work around one project can be stored and updated in one
                place, rather than having multiple files that become out of sync with each other and lost.
            </p>
            <p>
                Miro's user experience is excellent. Its clean user interface and intuitive navigation make it easy to
                use, even for those who have not used it before, such as my junior colleague. This is useful because
                they can onboard themselves onto the tool, unlike other tools I have worked with such Office 365.
            </p>
            <h3>
                6. Use user research to validate requirements
            </h3>
            <p>
                The user research findings were used to clarify and prioritise the requirements and create a shared
                understanding between the teams. I did this by identifying what the user needs were, based on their
                organisational setup and how they worked. Compared to the start of the project, we now had a clear
                structure and a timeline to implement the requirements. This made discussions easier because they were
                more focused, which helped progress the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having a clear set of requirements that meet user needs is important for many reasons. For instance,
                they define the purpose of the feature and the criteria for the minimum viable product. They allow the
                PM, and the teams involved, to monitor changes in requirements and track their progress at any point of
                the product lifecycle. This helps the project team monitor the project's overall progress and plan
                resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the user needs are not understood in the early stages, it risks problems later on. The time and cost
                spent to rectify these problems may be detrimental to the business. Lastly, working out the product
                requirements early on gives teams a clear goal, aligns understanding and allows time for focused
                exploration and ideation.

                7. Store findings in a central repository
            </h3>
            <p>
                I recorded the findings and requirements timeline in Miro and in Figma, where the designs were stored. I
                annotated the designs and identified which features were for the first and future releases. Despite
                recording this research, I was concerned about its accessibility and whether it would be remembered 6
                months, a year down the line. I knew this issue would grow as more research was conducted. As a result,
                I told my manager about the benefits of a research repository and highlighted my concerns. Finding an
                appropriate repository and its implementation is still being explored.
            </p>
            <p>
                To grow a research culture, I think it is important that organisations have a central repository to
                store data. This is so it can be accessed, shared and used throughout the organisation. Having all the
                research insights, recommendations and product roadmaps in one place makes it easier to organise and
                plan projects across teams. In addition, with the correct features, a repository helps to manage data by
                organising it and ensuring it is accurate. This helps management teams make effective decisions based on
                accurate and reliable data. Also, if the data is managed in one place, changes and updates are reflected
                automatically across whole workflows, rather than relying on someone to update individual systems.
                Ultimately, organisations with a research repository will generate more revenue and save more money than
                companies who do not, due to better quality data and informed decision making.

                8. Communicate with developers
            </h3>
            <p>
                When I presented the new designs and behaviours to the developers, I experienced push back on the
                requirements. The developers explained the service architecture underneath my designs, and the proposed
                requirements, did not exist and would take a large amount of time and effort to build. They argued the
                resource needed to build it outweighed how essential it was to the overall product roadmap. They
                basically said, "We can't build that filter system based on the criteria you have given us, can we just
                not include it?".
            </p>
            <p>
                When discussing the requirements, I assumed the PMs were aware of the underlying architecture and had an
                understanding of what could be built. This experience highlighted the importance of not making
                assumptions and communicating with developers early and often. After discussion between the PMs and
                Development, I changed my designs based on what was achievable in the back end architecture. Compromises
                were made to the user experience, however, the PMs weighed up the cost and benefits and were willing to
                make this trade-off. Once we were all aligned, the Development team began to investigate and build the
                back end.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although UX design does not want to be driven by development, you need to be on the same page. This
                ensures you have a shared understanding at a high level about what is possible. Designs should be shown
                to developers early and often to get feedback on finer details such as component behaviour, user flows
                and interactions. Frequent communication prevents miscommunication and will ultimately lead to better
                developed designs. It will also avoid delays and redesign in the later stages of the project, which can
                cause frustration amongst everyone involved.

                The best project I have worked on followed the above approaches. Its success was recognised at all
                levels of the company, including senior management and the C-Suite. Knowing which developer was
                implementing my work, so they could be involved in the design stage and I could be involved in the
                development stage was key to its success. This was achieved through direct contact, clarifying work,
                asking questions and doing mini demos mid-sprint. This allowed us to bounce ideas off each other and
                validate concepts before time was invested in them. Conflict, tensions and re-work were avoided helping
                with the projects successful completion.

                Conclusion
            </h3>
            <p>
                Performing user research facilitated the progression of this project. It was fundamental for
                understanding user needs, validating requirements and aligning understanding between teams. It allowed
                the PMs to outline the project goal which reduced uncertainty and bought the project into focus. The
                aligned understanding made discussion and collaboration easier and more constructive. Finally, it
                validated and rejected our assumptions, meaning we felt confident that we were building something that
                met the user's needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Getting approval to conduct user research signified the break down of traditional organisational
                barriers that prevented the UX team from performing user research. Its impact in this project will
                support cultural change in the organisation about attitudes towards, and understanding of, user
                research.
            </p>

                For me the key takeaways for future projects will be:
                <ul class="case-study-text">
                    <li class="case-study-list">Better communication with developers to ensure there is a clear
                        understanding between design and development teams about what is feasible.
                    </li>
                    <li class="case-study-list">
                        Conduct user research earlier and more frequently to ensure design and development time is not
                        spent creating a product/feature which is not suitable for the user.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
